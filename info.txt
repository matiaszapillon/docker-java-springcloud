The difference between RUN and CMD is that RUN command lets you execute commands inside of your docker image.
These commands get executed once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer. 
CMD lets you define a default command to run when your container starts.


It is necessary to put a 'wait' in EOF start.sh, otherwise the docker container finishes immediatly.
